# AWS_MYTool

This repository was set up to store the AWSCLI toolkits I created for my work.

<br>

## CloudFormation

  - get_nonCFnResource.py

  This tool is used to clear which AWS Resource is not handled as CloudFormation Resource.

<br>

## ConfigComplianceCheck

- NonComplianceList.py

I don't know why I wanted to make this script.  
You can get NonCompliamceError resource list checked by AWS Config.  
There needs not README.md in the folder.

<br>
## get_lambda_info

Maybe it's an unfinished script.  
It's a mix of Powershell and Python scripts that are very confusing.  
I think I wanted to list the Lamdba functions in the region because they were almost overflowing with them.  
I'm wondering if I'll use it occasionally if I have it, if I can complete it.
